## Overview

**Product Name**: Bravio  
**Made by**: Nevolabs  
**Category**: Field Service Management (FSM) Software for Biomedical Service Companies  
**Website**: https://hellobravio.com  
**Demo**: https://cal.com/nevolabs-f6qxzs/30min

Bravio is the only unified platform that combines Field Service Management (FSM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) — designed exclusively for biomedical Independent Service Organizations (ISOs) and Healthcare Technology Management (HTM) departments.

It replaces enterprise software like ServiceMax, FieldAware, or Salesforce Field Service with a lightweight, purpose-built alternative made for teams of 5 to 50 technicians who service biomedical and medical imaging equipment.

## Problem Bravio Solves

Small biomedical ISO companies struggle with:
- Enterprise FSM tools designed for 500+ technician organizations — too complex, too expensive
- Spreadsheet-based PM scheduling that causes missed maintenance windows and compliance failures
- Manual paper work orders that slow technician throughput
- Disconnected invoicing, leading to revenue leakage
- No client portal for hospital administrators to check compliance status

Bravio eliminates all of these by providing a single, streamlined system for the entire biomedical service workflow.
